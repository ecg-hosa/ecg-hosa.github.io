# Service Events

Because club members are interested in the medical field, 
HOSA typically hosts one health-related service event per month.

However, because of the ongoing pandemic, we have cancelled theses events for the 2020-2021 school year. 
We hope to pick them up again in the future.

## Here are some of our past service events:
- Chick-Fil-A Fundraiser with St. Jude's Comprehensive Cancer Center
- Bone Marrow Drive
- EMS Ride Along
- STEAM Fair at Jefferson Elementary School
- Hosting a Booth at Greensboro Pride
