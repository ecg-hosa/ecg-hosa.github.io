<p>This event will be held completely virtual. 
	Regionals is a great time to practice and showcase your skills, but it is not required for most events.</p>

<h2>States</h2>
<p>In the Spring of 2021, HOSA plans to participate in the State Leadership Conference. 
At the moment, it is set to be at the Koury Convention Center, but it might move online. 
The competition fee is usually around $75, some of it can be covered by fundraising or a PTSA mini-grant.</p>

<h2>Internationals</h2>
<p>If you place top three in your event at states, you have the chance to advance to Internationals. The ILC 2021 is set to be in Orlando, Florida, but it may also move online. The cost of the ILC itself is usually $145, but there may be additional costs, such as hotel fees.</p>
