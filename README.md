# ECG HOSA
- This is the current repository for the ECG HOSA website. It's inspired by the [original one](https://ecg-hosa.github.io/archived) but has a more minimalist and cleaner look.
- The website uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to create static site pages. 
Jekyll allows each page have the same format (such as header section, footer, navigation bar, etc) without having to make a copy on each page.
- See [About](https://ecg-hosa.github.io/bib.html) to learn more about the design.
