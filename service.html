<h1>Past Service Events</h1>
	<p>Because club members are interested in the medical field, HOSA typically hosts one health-related service event per month. 
	However, because of the ongoing pandemic, we have cancelled theses events for the 2020-2021 school year. We hope to pick them up again in the future.</p>

<h2>Here are some of our previous service events:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Chick-Fil-A Fundraiser with St. Jude's Comprehensive Cancer Center</li>
	<li>Bone Marrow Drive</li>
	<li>EMS Ride Along</li>
	<li>STEAM Fair at Jefferson Elementary School</li>
	<li>Pride Booth in Downtown Greensboro</li>
</ul>
